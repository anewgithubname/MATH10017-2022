# Response to Mid-Unit Feedback

Thanks to those who participated the mid-unit feedback! I am glad that you are overall positive about this unit and are actively engaged. 

Here I would like to address your concerns: 

- The homework should be marked quicker. 
  - I agree. Branden and I are trying to streamline the feedback/marking procedure. For example, we will standardize the homework output format, so it is easy for us to tell right/wrong. This will be one of the main area we aim to improve in the next term. 

- Give students more Programming question problem sets. / more questions/ harder questions. 
  - I think I agree with the idea, that programming should be learned by practicing often. However, I *do not advocate programming for the sake of it*. Programming languages are tools for solving problems. I tend to believe that one learns programming fast when there is a "project" to motivate you (that is the idea behind CW1 and CW2). I think rather than giving you "questions sets", I prefer to give you "project ideas" for you to explore. This is an avenue I will explore in the next term. 
  - We will also include additional bonus questions for you to explore after the regular questions. 

- Please just release the lecture notes before lectures s.t. we can preview them. 
  - My apologies. In the next term, slides (or a draft version of it) will be released at least 24 hours before the lecture. 

- no one can learn to code by watching someone else. Much better to substitute the lecture for another lab.
  - As I mentioned in the previous comment, I agree with the idea that programming should be learned by practicing. However, I intend to keep the lecture for two reasons: 
  - Learning from demonstration is important. Comparing to the lab, lecture is the only chance I can have your undivided attention. I tried demonstrating in the lab before but with a computer screen in front of students, many are not listening. 
  - This unit is not purely about coding (and I do not think data scientist should be a coder only). Rather, I would like to introduce the computing model behind coding (such as stack memory vs heap memory) and problem solving skills. Such information is difficult to convey without a proper lecture.
